#Photo-hosting

This code can download EVERY single picture from a micropic.ru photo hosting.

There was no available API for that, so I made a class that generates a unique pictures' id from "00000" to "ZZZZZ", sends an API request, and if the image with given ID exists, this program downloads it.


WARNING: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PICTURES YOU ARE GOING TO SEE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
